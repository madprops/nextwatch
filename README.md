Create `~/.config/nextwatch/config.toml`

Set `path = "/path/to/videos/main/dir"`

Set `player = "haruna"`

Run nextwatch, choose a file

Watched files will have [W] at the start of the name

When you select a file it is added to `~/.config/nextwatch/watched.json`

There's a `[!] Filter` action to filter out watched files
