Install [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) to display the interface

Config: `~/.config/nextwatch/config.json`

This is created on first launch if not existent

Set `path = "/path/to/videos"`

Set `player = "yourVideoPlayer"`

Run nextwatch, choose a file

Watched files will have [W] at the start of the name

When you select a file it is added to `~/.config/nextwatch/watched.json`

There's a `[!] Filter` action to filter out watched files

Alt + 1 to toggle `Watched` on items

If only 1 dir is shown (no files), it enters that dir automatically
